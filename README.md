# Machine Learning Approaches to Dissect Hybrid and Vaccine-Induced Immunity

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper titled "***Machine Learning Approaches to Dissect Hybrid and Vaccine-Induced Immunity***" authored by *G. Montesi, S. Costagli, S. Lucchesi et al*.

## Overview

The project focuses on developing a Machine Learning pipeline to ... . This repository provides the implementation details, synthetic datasets, and instructions to reproduce the analysis presented in the manuscript.

## Repository Structure

-   `data/`: Contains the synthetic datasets used for training and evaluation.
-   `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating Machine Learning analysis proposed in the manuscript applied to synthetic datasets.
-   `R/`: R scripts implementing the core functionalities of the project.
-   `LICENSE`: The MIT License under which this project is released.
-   `ML_UI_detection.Rproj`: R project file for easy environment setup.

## Synthetic Data

Please note that the datasets provided in this repository are synthetic and were generated to demonstrate the model's capabilities. They do not correspond to the real data used in the actual study due to ... . The synthetic data allows users to understand and replicate the methodology without accessing proprietary information.

## Getting Started

To set up the project environment and run the code, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/Giomu/ML_UI_detection.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ``` bash
    cd ML_UI_detection
    ```

3.  Install the required packages: Ensure that you have R installed on your system. Then, install the necessary packages by running:

    ``` r
    install.packages(c("mclust", "umap", "Rtsne", "ggplot2", "fpc", "caret", "dplyr"))
    ```

4.  Open the R project: Open the `ML_UI_detection.Rproj` file in RStudio to set the working directory automatically.

5.  Run the notebooks: Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to explore data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. Usage

Detailed instructions on how to use the code, including examples, are provided within the notebook in the `notebooks/` directory. The notebook walk through the entire process from data loading to model evaluation.
